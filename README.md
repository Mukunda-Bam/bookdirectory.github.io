It is the most basic project using Node JS and Express JS or Nest JS where we learn how to get started with REST APIs using Node JS and Express JS or Nest JS.
In this project, we develop/build a backend REST API where we perform CRUD operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting the data.We will
be building a book directory where we can get the books from the collection, add a new book to the collection, update the collection, and remove the books from
the collection. The database for this purpose will be MongoDB. For building an app like this, i.e., having a collection of books or a book directory, we need to create
endpoints. Remember, endpoints are location: one end of a communication channel occurs when an API interacts with another system for data. For creating 
endpoints, we use four basic methods: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. For obtaining all of the books
POST is used to add books to the list, PUT is used to update books in the list, and GET is used to remove books from the list.
DELETE is used in the list. For this type of app, we do not need to necessarily use the database; we might use data collected as a JSON file.Â 

### For this we need four node js modules:

Express: To create server and routes
Body-parser: Package to read and display response in json form
Mongoose: Llibrary to manage data in mongoDB (CRUD opearation)
Nodemon: Script to auto-restart node js server, when file changes are made

# Features of books directory: 
   Management of database using mongoDB.
   Searchbar to search for the required book.
   Slide menu which lists all the author books, author, genres.
   Making proper API calls
